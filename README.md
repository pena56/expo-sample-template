# Minimal Template (Cloned from React Native Reusables)

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [React Native Reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com).

It was initialized using the following command:

```bash
npx @react-native-reusables/cli@latest init -t expo-sample
```

## TODO FOR NEW PROJECT

- Create Project on Expo
- Update app.config.ts with credentials from the project created in step 1
- Update environment variables for all supported environments on eas
- Follow the steps here https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/fcm-credentials/ to setup Push notifications for android (Repeat this for dev, preview, and production builds)

## Adding components

You can add more reusable components using the CLI:

```bash
npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add [...components]
```

> e.g. `npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add input textarea`

If you don't specify any component names, you'll be prompted to select which components to add interactively. Use the `--all` flag to install all available components at once.
